17) What is use of NVL and NVL2 function?
--->> NVL - It is used to provide alternative value if column value is null
      NVL2 - It is used exp1 value is null then consider exp3 value and exp1 is not null then consider exp2.

           2. It is used to gives alternative value if EXP1 is null
              If EXP1 is not null then consider same value..
     NVL2 -1. NVL2(EXP1,EXP2,EXP3)
           2. IF EXP1 is null then consider EXP3 and if EXP1 is not null then consider EXP2
