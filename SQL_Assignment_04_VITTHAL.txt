Q. SQL statements are classified into how many groups and what are these
   groups?
--->> Statements has classified into 5 groups as-
1. DDL- Data Definition Language
2. DML- Data Manipulation Language
3. DQL- Data Query Language
4. DCL- Data control Language
5. TCL-Transaction control language

Q. Under DML which statements come?
--->>INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE

Q. Under DDL Which statements come?
--->>CREATE,ALTER,DROP,TRUNCATE,RENAME, COMMENT

Q. Under DQL which statements come?
-->> SELECT 

Q. Under DCL which statements come?
-->> GRANT, REVOKE

Q. Under TCL Which statements Come?
-->>COMMIT, ROLLBACK

Q. What is purpose of commit statement?
-->> After DML statement COMMIT gives permanent changes in database, after COMMIT we can't rollback.

Q. What is purpose of rollback statement?
-->> After DML statemet apply, we can rollback changes before COMMIT If need.

Q. Can we rollback after the commit?
-->> NO, We can't rollback.

Q. How many types of SQL functions are there?
--->> TWO typeS 
1. SINGLE ROW FUNCTION-
2. MULTI ROW FUNCTION-

Q. What is mean by single row function?
-->> Numeric function accept that accept numeric type value and return numeric value
   

Q. What is mean by multi row function?
-->> the function which operate on multiple rows
   --- the function operate on group of values and generate single value 

Q. State the names of functions which operate on char data type?
-->>character function

Q. What is use of lower function and explain its syntax?
-->>Convert UPPER case to LOWER case 
    SELECT LOWER('VITTHAL') FROM DUAL -->>vitthal

Q. What is use of upper function and explain its syntax?
-->> Convert LOWER case to UPPER case
     SELECT UPPER('vitthal') FROM DUAL; -->> VITTHAL

Q. What is use of initcap function and explain its syntax?
-->>Convert and remains first letter capital and other in lower case
    SELECT INICAP(vitthal) from dual; --->> Vitthal


Q. What is use of length function and explain its syntax?
-->>calculate lenght of given character/input in number
   SELECT LENGHT('VITTHAL') FROM DUAL;  ------> 7

Q. What is use of concat function and explain its syntax?
--->> join to TWO strings in single
   SELECT CONCAT('VITTHAL','KARCHE') FROM DUAL; --->> VITTHALKARCHE
  
Q. What is use of LPAD function and explain its syntax?
-->>ADD extra character at left side of source string
SELECT LPAD(SOURCE_STRING,NUMBER,TARGET_CHARACTER) from dual; --->> 0000VITTHAL


Q. What is use of RPAD function and explain its syntax?
--->>ADD extra character at right side of source string
SELECT RPAD(SOURCE_STRING,NUMBER,TARGET_CHARACTER) from dual; --->> VITTHAL0000


Q. What is use of LTRIM function and explain its syntax?
-->> To remove extra space or special character from left END
SELECT LTRIM(SOURCE_STRING) FROM DUAL;

Q. What is use of RTRIM function and explain its syntax?
-->>To remove extra space or special character from right END
SELECT RTRIM(SOURCE_STRING) FROM DUAL;

Q. What is use of TRIM function and explain its syntax?
-->> To remove extra space or special character from both side right+left END
SELECT TRIM(SOURCE_STRING) FROM DUAL;

Q. What is use of REPLACE function and explain its syntax?
-->> replace one character into another one
   SELECT REPLACE (SOURCE_STRING,'SOURCE_CHARACTER','TARGET') FROM DUAL;


Q. What is use of SUBSTR function and explain its syntax?
--->> Find string from start index to given in lenght character
SELECT SUBSTR(SOURCE_STRING,START_INDEX_NUMBER,LENGHT_STRING) FROM DUAL;

-------------------------------
Q. Trace the Output for the following Query
1) Select upper(substr('abcdefghij',2,'2')) from dual;
---->cd
--------------------------
2) select concat(substr('1234567891',1,3),concat('XXXX',substr('1234567891',9,2))) from dual;
--->> 123XXXX91
--------------------------
3) select 111+123 from dual;
--->> 234
--------------------------
4) select lenght('Welcome'), upper('Welcome'),lower('Welcome') From dual;
--->> 7 WELCOME welcome
--------------------------
5) select initcap('welcome'),upper('Welcome') from dual where 1=0;
--->> NO OUTPUT
--------------------------
6) select initcap('welcome'),upper('Welcome') from dual where 1=1;
--->>Welcome WELCOME
--------------------------
7) select replace('Welcome',lower('E'),'upper('e')) from dual;
--->>> WElcomE
--------------------------
8)  select  LPAD('welcome',3,'#') from dual;
--->> wel

9)  select  RPAD('welcome',3,'#') from dual;
--->>wel

10) select  RPAD('welcome',10,'#') from dual;
--->>> welcome###

11) select  LTRIM('*#welcome#*','#') from dual;
--->> *#welcome#*

12) select  RTRIM('#welcome#','#') from dual where 1=0;
--->> NO  DATA

13) select  TRIM('#welcome#','#') from dual;
---->> welcome

14) select  upper(RPAD('welcome'),7,'#')) from dual;
--->>WELCOME

15) select  LPAD(Upper('welcome'),10,'*') from dual;
--->> ***WELCOME
